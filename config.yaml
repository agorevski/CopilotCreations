  On top of what will be explained below, this is a brand new project that should have everything that a professional developer comes to expect from a brand new project. A CI/CD pipeline, Unit Tests, a professional directory structure, gitignore files, and documentation.

  The directory structure should look something like this:
  ```
  root/
  ├── run.py                # Application entry point
  ├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
  ├── .env.example          # Example environment file (if applicable)
  ├── .gitignore            # Git ignore patterns
  │
  ├── .github/workflows/    # Github actions to compile any projects and run unit tests
  │    ...
  ├── src/                  # Source code
  │    ...
  ├── tests/                # Test suite
  │    ...
  ├── docs/                 # Documentation
      ├── ARCHITECTURE.md   # Architectural information
      ├── SUGGESTIONS.md    # Additional suggestions to further improve upon the current design
      └── USAGE.md          # User guide
  ```

  Please ensure that documentation is exhaustive and complete, and that unit test coverage at the end of this run is at least 75% before completing the task.

  - Always create a docs/ directory with comprehensive documentation
  - Always include a .github/workflows/ directory with CI/CD pipeline configuration
  - Always include unit tests with good coverage
  - Follow best practices for the language/framework being used
